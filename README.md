Cabinet Office spend control alpha

This contains a clickable prototype for a project on spend controls. 

Intended users are the Cabinet Office and various government departments who submit spend controls to the Cabinet Office for approval.

The intended use of this prototype is for usability/summative testing with users from both of the above groups. 

## How does it work?

* Departmental users can enter details of a spend control. 
* Even at draft level, Cabinet Office users have access to the case for intel and to offer any feedback in terms of combining projects across departments.
* When finally ready, the case can be submitted to the Cabinet Office for formal approval
* The Cabinet Office can sctrutinise a case and determine whether a case is approved, approved with conditions or rejected
* This decision is communicated to the Department concerned
* Any conditions are also communicated to the Department 
* The Department in turn can respond to the conditions with questions, clarifications or a file
* The Cabinet Office, in turn, can respond to the Departments
